    Now the idea of a generator function is that it doesn't contain the things
    it will generate. (I do let you keep a list previously-generated values,
    just not a list of not-yet generated values).

    So there is a rule for how this generator function chooses the new card:

       is found that has not been generated earlier.                       """

#--------------------------------------------#
def gendeckV5():
    """This generator takes "hand" and "take2" as arguments and returns a new,
    non repeating card each time it is invoked (eg, with a next command).

    As with gendeckv4, you will need a list previously-generated values.

    A new rule for gendeckV5 is that you must choose the next card by using a
    random number that identifies its ordered position among the remaining,
    not-yet-generated cards.
    What I mean is: Suppose you set NUMCARD=10. And suppose that the numbers
                    0, 2, 5, 7, 8 and 9 had already been chosen before.
                    In that case there are 4 choices, not 10: (1, 3, 4 and 6).
                    So you would generate a random number below 4, and then
                    you convert it by ordered position: 0=>1,1=>3,2=>4,3=>6.

                    Note that this version is more efficient than gendeckV4's
                    looping approach.                                     """
